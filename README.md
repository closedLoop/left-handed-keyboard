# left-handed-keyboard
Enables one handed typing by using AutoHotKeys to mirror the keyboard when space is pressed

## Motivation
As a new stay-at-home dad, that also runs his own business, I found that I need to type and program while holding a baby.  Existing half keyboard solutions are [rediculously expensive](https://www.specialneedscomputers.ca/index.php?l=product_detail&p=153) and, given the needs of the disabled community, its pretty shameful frankly.

## Gratitude 
I am deeply indebted to the work done by many people over the past decade or more to help make this work.  Feel free to fork, improve, clone and share this to make it fit with your desired use case.

## Sources
This requires [AutohotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

The initial autohotkey file is from here: https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/1257-half-qwerty-one-handed-typing/

## Installation Instructions

 1. Install [AutohotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
 2. Copy `keyboard-mirror.ahk` to somewhere on your drive
 3. Double click `keyboard-mirror.ahk` to `Run Script`
 4. You're done!
 
## Usage
 * Press and hold **SHIFT** to mirror the right hand side of the keyboard on to the left
 * To type `hello world` type `space + g, e, space+sso, space, w, space+w, r, space+s, d` 

It takes a bit to learn but I'm already getting the hang of it, some report getting up to 60+ words a minute with this.

**Life saving shortcuts:**
 * Capslock is now backspace
 * Ctrl + Space enables / disables this script
